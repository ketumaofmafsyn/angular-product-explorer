# ✅ Solution Architecture & Technical Decisions

This document explains the architectural choices, state management strategy, routing approach, and scalability considerations used in this Angular Product Explorer SPA.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The application follows a feature-based structure with a shared Core layer:

- **Core** → Services, models, and guards
- **Features** → Catalog, Product Details, Favorites, Admin
- **Layout** → Header and global layout components

Each feature is isolated and lazy-loaded, making the app scalable and easy to maintain.

Standalone components are used throughout the application to reduce NgModule complexity and improve clarity.

---

## 🚦 Routing & Lazy Loading Strategy

All major routes are lazy-loaded using:

- `loadComponent`
- `loadChildren`

This ensures:

- Faster initial load
- Smaller JS bundles
- Clear separation of feature domains

Example features that are lazy-loaded:
- Catalog
- Product Details
- Favorites
- Admin Dashboard

This structure aligns well with enterprise Angular standards and supports future micro-frontend adoption.

---

## 🔐 Route Guards

An `AdminGuard` protects the `/admin` route.

Currently:
- Admin access is mocked using a local flag

In production:
- Guard would validate JWT token or user roles
- Guard could query backend or auth service

The guard is decoupled from UI logic and easily replaceable.

---

## ⚡ State Management with Signals

Instead of NgRx, Angular Signals are used for state:

- Favorites list
- Favorites counter
- UI reactivity

### Why Signals?

- Minimal boilerplate
- Built into Angular
- Ideal for localized and UI-driven state
- Easier learning curve for small-to-medium apps

### Trade-off

Signals are not ideal for:
- Complex async workflows
- Large-scale global state
- Cross-domain side effects

For larger systems, NgRx or SignalStore would be introduced.

---

## 💾 Persistence Strategy

Favorites are persisted using:

- `localStorage`

On app startup:
- Favorites are restored automatically

This simulates backend persistence without requiring APIs and keeps UX consistent across refreshes.

---

## 🎨 UI & Responsiveness

The UI is built using:

- CSS Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first principles

Key design goals:
- Fixed header
- Scrollable content area
- Responsive product grids
- Mobile-friendly image gallery

---

## 🧩 Micro-Frontend Readiness

The app is structured to support micro-frontends:

- Feature-based routing
- Lazy-loaded boundaries
- Isolated services
- Shared Core layer

Future approach:
- Module Federation
- Deploy each feature independently
- Share authentication and models as shared libraries

This makes the app enterprise-ready.

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs & Constraints

### No backend API
- Mock data used for faster delivery
- Services structured to easily swap to HTTP later

### No NgRx
- Signals preferred for simplicity
- Reduced boilerplate
- Faster development

### Minimal UI libraries
- Focus on functionality over design frameworks

---

## 📈 Scalability Plan

If product evolved:

1. Add backend API
2. Introduce authentication
3. Add admin CRUD features
4. Introduce NgRx for global state
5. Add SSR for SEO
6. Add automated testing

The current architecture supports this growth without major refactoring.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

- Clean Angular architecture
- Lazy loading and routing best practices
- Reactive state management using Signals
- Guarded routes
- Feature isolation
- Scalable structure

It reflects patterns commonly used in enterprise Angular applications while keeping implementation simple and maintainable.
