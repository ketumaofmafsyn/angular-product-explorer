A single-page application (SPA) built with modern Angular using standalone components, signals, and lazy-loaded routes.  
The app allows users to browse products, view details with image galleries, manage favorites, and access a protected admin dashboard.

This project was built as part of a technical assessment to demonstrate Angular architecture, routing, state management, and UI responsiveness.

## 🧭 Routes

| Route | Description | Lazy Loaded |
|--------|------------|------------|
| `/catalog` | Product listing page | ✅ |
| `/product/:id` | Product details + gallery | ✅ |
| `/favorites` | Favorite products | ✅ |
| `/admin` | Admin dashboard (guarded) | ✅ |

---

## 🔐 Admin Access

The `/admin` route is protected using an `AdminGuard`.

Currently, admin access is simulated using a local flag inside the guard.  
This can easily be replaced with real authentication and role-based access from a backend API or JWT token.
